*Reason for Admission:*  
The patient was admitted to the hospital on March 1, 2024, due to severe chest pain radiating to the left arm and accompanied by shortness of breath. These symptoms were suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, prompting immediate medical evaluation and intervention. The patient's background includes risk factors for cardiovascular disease, necessitating urgent assessment and management to prevent further cardiac compromise.

*Hospital Course:*  
Upon admission, the patient underwent an electrocardiogram (ECG) which revealed an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), specifically affecting the anterior wall. Immediate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, including stent placement, which stabilized the patient's condition. Initial laboratory tests showed elevated troponin levels, peaking 12 hours post-admission, indicative of myocardial injury. Continuous monitoring and daily ward rounds were conducted, during which the patient showed progressive improvement. By March 2, the patient reported feeling better, with decreasing troponin levels and stable vital signs. Over the subsequent days, the patient's condition continued to improve significantly, with no recurrent chest pain and stable cardiac function. Discharge planning commenced on March 4, with a focus on rehabilitation and patient education regarding lifestyle modifications and medication adherence.

*Diagnosis:*  
The final diagnosis was an acute transmural myocardial infarction of the anterior wall. Differential diagnoses such as other causes of chest pain were ruled out based on clinical presentation and diagnostic findings.

*Condition on Discharge:*  
At the time of discharge on March 6, 2024, the patient was in stable condition. Vital signs were within normal limits, and the patient was hemodynamically stable with no signs of recurrent ischemia. The patient was ambulatory, with no cognitive impairments, and reported no residual chest pain. The patient was well-oriented and able to understand and comply with discharge instructions.

*Medications on Discharge:*  
The patient was discharged with a comprehensive medication regimen to support cardiac recovery and prevent further cardiac events. Aspirin 325 mg once daily and Clopidogrel 75 mg once daily were continued as antiplatelet therapy. A beta-blocker, Metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, and an ACE inhibitor, Lisinopril 10 mg once daily, were prescribed to manage blood pressure and reduce cardiac workload. A statin, 40 mg once daily, was initiated to address elevated LDL cholesterol levels. Nitroglycerin was prescribed as needed for any recurrent chest pain, although the patient had not experienced further episodes during the hospital stay.

*Follow-Up and Recommendations:*  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment at the cardiology outpatient clinic on March 20, 2024, to assess recovery progress and medication management. It is crucial for the patient to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen and attend all follow-up appointments. The patient has been advised to adopt a heart-healthy diet, engage in gradual physical activity, and cease smoking immediately, with support options such as nicotine replacement therapy and counseling offered. Stress management techniques, including mindfulness and yoga, were recommended to support overall well-being. The patient was instructed to monitor for any signs of recurrent chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if these occur. Pending test results include a repeat lipid profile to be reviewed during the follow-up visit.
